# Voice Controlled Robotic Arm
Ever needed an extra hand or arm? Maybe you have too many things to hold. Or you are too far away from something and you are struggling to reach for it. Using this voice controlled robotic arm, just with a few commands, this robotic arm is under your control.

# Final Milestone
While getting information from the ultrasonic sensor, if the ultrasonic sensor detects someone without a mask that is less than 200 centimeters away, then I wrote a program for the raspberry pi to login into the server and send an email to me. This email warns me that I have come into contact with someone who wasn't following safe COVID-19 protocols. In this project, I struggled on getting the email to work because of gmail restrictions. After it worked, I had a wave of relief because I had spent a lot of time on this. I'm happy with my project and I plan to get more RAM to train my own model that works better.

# Second Milestone
My second milestone is I trained a cascade model to detect a mouth. I took videos of people and cropped the video to show just the mouth. I then wrote a python program to take each frame of the video and save it as a JPG file. This images are used to train the model. I ran into an error where the images were taking up too much storage. This was because I recorded the videos in 4K. I changed the resolution to SD and split up the videos again so that the images would be a lower resolution. This fixed the storage problem. I also connect an ultrasonic sensor to detect the distance between someone and the location of the sensor. This will be part of the "Social Distancing" section of this project. I programmed the ultrasonic sensor to detect the distance and return it.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was getting everything set up. I connected 5 servos to an arduino through a breadboard. I also figured out how to use serial communication between a Raspberry Pi and Arduino Uno to incorporate some computer vision with this project. I attached an external battery back to separately power the servos because of a power issue. Finally, I got 5 fingers designed and printed out.
